A scriptable object for holding the parameters that control the AI. Some of the names are really confusing(even I don't remember what they do), sorry! The timers control when an enemy can attack, when it is considered to be in combat and for how long before it gets registered as not in combat. these were needed to solve the issue of the player becoming invincible at the max engaged enemies threshold.
